# Simple Counter ⏱️

This is a simple counter, the funcionatilly is pretty simple, just insert the first number and the second number in terminal, then the program will substrae the first number with second and print the numbers of the result.

## ⭕ Error can occurs!

To prevent user insert first number bigger than the second, i created a personalized a _Runtime Exception_ to catch and display a message to try again, and other that catch _InputMismatchException_ to avoid the user using float numbers instead of integers.
